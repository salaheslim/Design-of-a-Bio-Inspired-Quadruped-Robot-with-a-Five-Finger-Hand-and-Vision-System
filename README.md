# Design of a Bio-Inspired Quadruped Robot with a Five-Finger Hand and Vision System

This repository contains the CAD design files and documentation for a bio-inspired quadruped robot developed for the CIS7035 PRAC1 assessment.

## Project Overview
The robot combines:
- A dog-inspired quadruped base for stable locomotion
- A 6-DOF robotic arm
- A five-finger anthropomorphic hand
- A palm-mounted eye-in-hand vision system

The design focuses on mobility, stability, and dexterous manipulation in unstructured environments.

## Repository Contents
- `/STEP and PDF/` – Exported STEP models and PDF drawings for fabrication and simulation
- `/Save Bodies Arm/` – Individual arm components
- `/Save Bodies Spot/` – Quadruped body components
- `README.md` – Project description

## Software Used
- SolidWorks (CAD modelling)

## Notes
Native SolidWorks files were converted to STEP format to ensure compatibility and accessibility.
